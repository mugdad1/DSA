Experiment 1: Static Memory Allocation

Instruction:
    â€¢ Perform the following experiment using Program 1 and answer the given questions.

    1. Copy Program 1 code in Dev C++ then run the program.
    2. (Execution 1) During run time select [1]yes to add 5 more elements in the array.
    3. Then press [2] to print all array elements.
    4. Record the allocated memory and the memory used by the program in table 1 below. See program output for allocated and used memory.
    5. (Execution 2) Run the application again, but this time try to add 10 more elements by pressing [1]yes twice.
    6. Then press [2] to print array elements.
    7. Again Record the allocated and used memory in table 1 below.

Question 1: (2 points)

Based on the performed experiment 1, explain how static memory allocation influence the efficiency of the program in terms of memory allocation and usage.

Type your answer inside this box.


//todo




Questions 2: (2 points)

Execute Program 1, then add 30 more elements in the array by choosing [1]yes for 6 times then press [2]no, to display the elements. Observe the output of the program and explain how does static memory allocation affects the efficiency of the program based on memory allocation and usage.
